about themis:

Themis is a statistichal mechanics software designed to obtain the association
thermodynamics of two structures (ions, molecules, crystals, nanoparticles and
etc...). It generates a configurational partition function by systematically
sampling the whole phase space using discrete grids to perform translations and
rotations of one structure around another. Interaction energy for each
microstate can be obtained by one of the potentials implemented or by using
external softwares.

Themis is written in Fortran 2003 and is freely available under GPL license.
Since it was written in modules, new potential functions and analysis routines 
can be easily implemented.
